    <h3><a name="Cause_of"></a> Cause of Palestine</h3>
    <p>It should be noted that the OIC Programme of Action has identified the cause of Palestine as a stand-alone priority. The question of Palestine, which was the <em>raison d'etre</em> of the OIC, has been a permanent item on the Organization’s agenda since its inception. The centrality of this cause has always been emphasized by almost all OIC meetings.<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a> With the start of the Middle East peace process in the Madrid Conference in 1991, which was attended by Israel and some Arab countries, several Middle Eastern actors relaxed their views on the Arab-Israeli conflict. Bahgat Korany describes that era by saying that “a few years ago, few would have imagined the signing of formal agreements or even the convening of multilateral Arab–Israeli talks. Visions of Omani delegates speaking publicly with Israeli counterparts in Moscow corridors would have seemed far–fetched as would suggestions that Saudi Arabia’s Prince Bandar might coordinate moves with U.S. Jewish leaders or that his country would host visiting Jewish delegates.”<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[13]</a> In this new environment in the Middle East, <a href="http://ww1.oic-oci.org/english/conf/is/6/6th-is-sum(final%20Com).htm">the OIC, at its summit in 1999</a>, made a dramatic departure from its long-held position on the Palestinian question by replacing its calls for liberating Palestine through military means with adopting positions calling for a peaceful resolution to the conflict with Israel based on the two-state solution. a> to help UNRWA survive one of its most difficult financial crises. </p>
    <h3><a name="Peace_and"></a>Peace and Security</h3>
    <p>Today, several conflicts and tension zones exist in the backyard of the OIC, and therefore, perennially appear on its agenda. This reality has called for developing the involvement of the Organization in promoting peace and security, especially regarding its member countries and Muslim communities in non-member states. To this end, the OIC has developed several mechanisms for responding to issues of peace and security, conflict prevention, mediation, and peaceful resolution of conflicts. Chief of these mechanisms have been appointing special envoys, forming ministerial contact groups, dispatching mediation delegations as well as holding high-level meetings etc. Below are a few examples of the prolonged conflicts on the OIC agenda.</p>
